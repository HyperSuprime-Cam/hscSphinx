Mustaches
^^^^^^^^^

Near the edge of the field, paired streaks of light which we're
calling 'mustaches' can often be found.  These appear to be scattered
light from bright sources just outside the field of view of the
camera.  The image below shows a cut-out of part of the camera, with a
bright mustache across two CCDs.  The adjacent sky image shows a very
bright source believed to be causing the mustache.
