Official HSC Site <http://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/>
    This is the official HSC project website.
    
HSC Projects      <http://hsca.ipmu.jp/hsc/projects/>
    The HSC Projects site is used to announce project plans to the rest of the collaboration.  At this site, you'll be able to query/search for existing projects, or fill out an online form to announce your own.

HSC Forum         <http://hsca.ipmu.jp:8080/>
    The HSC Forum is where you can post questions about how to use the software pipeline.  The site functions much like StackOverflow and any member can post a responce to your question.

HSC Trac          <http://hsc-gw1.mtk.nao.ac.jp:8000/>
    We use Trac as our bug tracker for HSC.  If you find a bug in the code, you can file a ticket to report it to the developers.  This provides the developers with an organized system for managing issues, bug fixes, and development.  Please let us know if you find a bug.

Schema Browser    <http://hsc-gw1.mtk.nao.ac.jp/schema_browser/hsc_online_schema_tableonly.html>
    The schema (layout of data tables) for our database are all listed here in an interactive display.  As the project evolves, we're likely to change field names, and this site will (should) always contain the latest information about the schema to help you construct your queries.

Doxygen           <http://hsca.ipmu.jp/doxygen/>
    Our software is documented using specially formatted comments in the code itself.  The 'doxygen' system reads these comments and contructs an interactive browsing tool to the software.

HSC PBWorks       <http://hscsurvey.pbworks.com>
    Much of the informal communication and document archiving for the HSC project is managed on a wiki at PBWorks.com.  You'll need a login for this site, though.  If you don't have one, please contact Masahiro Takada to request one.

Pipeline Install  <http://hscsurvey.pbworks.com/w/page/64515753/Pipeline%20Installation>
    If you'd like to install the software stack on your own system, we keep a set of instructions posted on the project wiki at this page.
