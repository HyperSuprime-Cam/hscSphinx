Indicated numbers are: CCD number, and Camera Team's detector name
('DETNAME').  Red boxes are plotted around amplifier 1 (of 4) for each
device.  The two-tone color shows the two blocks of the camera (you'll
notice that amplifier 1 is on the left in the light brown region, and
on the right in the dark brown region).
