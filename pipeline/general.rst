General Pipeline Info
=====================

There are a variety of things which are common to all tasks associated
with a processing run.  Some of the things are just basic terminology
that you'll need to communicate with developers, while others are of
more practical importance for actually running the pipeline code
effectively.


Reruns
------

The term ``rerun`` dates back to SDSS.  It simply refers to a single
processing run of a set of data performed with a specified version of
the reduction code, and a specific set of configuration parameters.
The assumption is that within a given 'rerun', the data have been
handled in a homogeneous way.
