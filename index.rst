Welcome to HSC Data's documentation!
====================================

This site hosts information relevant to running the HSC pipeline and
handling the data products in their various forms. We've tried (are
trying) to include any and all types of information that the science
collaborators may find useful or helpful in working with the data.
There is also a `PDF summary of pipeline ouputs
<http://hsca.ipmu.jp/datainfo.php>`_ and a `collection of IPython
notebooks <http://hsca.ipmu.jp/ipynb.php>`_ which contain more
specific information about the pipeline products. If you can't find
what you're looking for, please contact the software group and let us
know!  We can be found at <hsc_software@astro.princeton.edu>.

Some of the material is also translated to :ref:`Japanese <jp_index>`.
