This is the document for the user who want to have HSC SSP early data release(EDR) 
database contents on their own machine. 
As metadata and catalogs of HSC SSP data release are stored and managed with PostgreSQL, 
a free relational database server software, we've prepared the dump file of EDR. 


0. Prerequisites

   As we are using PostgreSQL as our DBMS for producing 

  (1) Please install and run PostgreSQL server on your machine.
      Version 9.3.4 or later one is strongly recommended. 

     Please read carefully the installation docoments attached with source distribution. 
     (It is not so difficult for installing from the source)

     You can get the source from http://www.postgresql.org/ 
     (http://www.postgresql.jp/ for Japanese)

     It is also OK to use binary distribution. 

  (2) You need about 687 GB for storing EDR S14A_0 database on your machine. 
      Please prepare devices like HDD or so with sufficient capacity for the 
      database table space. 

      The amount will be increased because the photoobj_frame table and related indeces are missing 
      in this release. 

1. Preparation for the database table restoration

  (1) As we need several users for using the EDR database, you should do create users 
      in your PostgreSQL server. 

      By using 'psql' command on your terminal you can access to database. 
      As database user 'postgres' is the superuser of the database, you should access as 
      'postgres'. 

      % psql -U postgres -d postgres -h your_hostname 
         (If you are running PostgreSQL server in remote host, -h option is essential.)

      You should create 3 users ('hscana', 'touroku', 'kensaku')on your database server.  
   
      User Name            Priviledge
     -------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
      hscana              owner of all tables in EDR database (can drop tables, schemas etc)
      kensaku             only select is allowed 
      touroku             select, insert and update are allowed 
     -------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------

     On 'psql' session, you should run the following commands for creating users. 

      psql> create user hscana with password 'something you want to set';
      psql> alter role hscana with createdb, createrole;
      psql> create user kensaku with password 'something you want to set';
      psql> create user touroku with password 'something you want to set';

     You can exit from 'psql' session by running '\q' command. 

  (2) Confirm the accessibility to your database by the user 'hscana'

      % psql -U hscana -d postgres -h your_hostname
 
      If the command failed, you should try to re-create user 'hscana'. 

  (3) Create your database instance. 

      % createdb -U hscana -h your_hostname database_name 
       If you want to create database instance 'dr_early' on the host 'takoyaki', 
       the command should be 'createdb -U hscana -h takoyaki dr_early'.

2. Download the dump file 

   The dump files of PostgreSQL can be downloaded from the site. 
   This site is under access control by user/password authentication.  

     https://hscdata.mtk.nao.ac.jp:4443/hsc_ssp/dr_early/DB_dump/

   There are 2 dump files, one for COSMOS and another for GAMA fields. 

     (COSMOS) pgdump_ssp_s14a0_udeep_20140523a_20140901.dmp.gz   (~100GB)
     (GAMA)   pgdump_ssp_s14a0_wide_20140523a_20140901.dmp.gz    (~189GB)

3. Restore the dump file into your database instance. 

   Unzip the dump files by using gunzip. 

   The name of dump files are 'pgdump_ssp_s14a0_udeep_20140523a_20140901.dmp' and   
   'pgdump_ssp_s14a0_wide_20140523a_20140901.dmp'. 

   You can restore these dump into your database by the following command. 

   % psql -U hscana -d dr_early -h your_hostname < /path/to/pgdump_ssp_s14a0_udeep_20140523a_20140901.dmp  
   % psql -U hscana -d dr_early -h your_hostname < /path/to/pgdump_ssp_s14a0_wide_20140523a_20140901.dmp  

   It will take for a while......

  The following command hopefully will work also. 
  (gunzip -c /path/to/pgdump_ssp_s14a0_udeep_20140523a_20140709.dmp.gz |  psql -U hscana -d dr_early -h your_hostname) 

4. Check the accessibility to your restored tables. 

   % psql -U kensaku -d dr_early -h your_hostname

   psql> select count(*) from ssp_s14a0_wide_20140523a.frame;

   If the count 10399 returned, it is OK. 

   Enjoy the HSC SSP database world !!

User document for searching the data you want to have is in the file 'HOWTO_USE_DR_DB', which 
is in the same site of pgdump files. 
The user document for knowing database and methods of database searches are in the user document 
at http://hsca.ipmu.jp/hscsphinx/database.html.
